"""Shared pytest configuration for the Beacon test suite.

ms-119 / e-4008: the attainment gate (`beacon milestone done` / `operation
close` / `target approve`) refuses direct completion / self-approval from an
*AI session*, treating an unset ``BEACON_SESSION_KIND`` as AI for safety (the
same convention as the PR merge ban). The pytest suite, however, is a
deterministic developer-run driver — its fixtures create and complete targets
as setup, not as an autonomous agent asserting an owned verdict. So the harness
declares itself human here, which is accurate and keeps setup flows unguarded.

Tests that specifically exercise the ban (test_attainment_gate_ban.py) override
this per-test via explicit env swaps, so the global default never masks them.
"""

import os

# Declare the test harness human-driven. os.environ mutation here also
# propagates to subprocess children (tests that invoke the `beacon` CLI), so
# both in-process command calls and subprocess runs inherit it.
os.environ.setdefault("BEACON_SESSION_KIND", "human")
